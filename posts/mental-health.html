      <h1>Growing up with a mentally ill cousin</h1>
      <em>Aug 13, 2024</em>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          My immediate family is small - two parents and a brother, and my
          extended family is not much bigger - a handful of cousins and
          aunts/uncles. Of those cousins one has severe mental health problems;
          it's not uncommon for said problems to seep into my day to day life.
          For many reasons I can't speak much about the problems specifically
          but they left scars on my upbringing/childhood &ndash; here's what I
          learnt about society at large as a result.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that that the world is going through somewhat of a mental
          health crisis so this form of thinking may help others as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Power and control</h3>
        <p>
          Learning to deal with techniques like manipulation, abuse, and
          violence (including violent thinking), and more generally learning to
          realize and avoid fear when possible.
        </p>
        <h3>Unpredictability and ambiguity</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding how to incorporate resilience, flexibility, and
          commitment into planning, preparation, and thought in general, and
          learning to deal with adversity in many ways.
        </p>
        <h3>Focus and attention</h3>
        <p>
          Learning the importance of training focus, understanding direction,
          and only paying attention to what's necessary at all times.
        </p>
        <h3>Detachment</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the qualms of attachment and learning to disconnect when
          necessary irregardless of the environment or situation at hand.
        </p>
        <h3>Mental health</h3>
        <p>
          Amongst others, learning issues like anxiety, depression,
          dissociation, and trauma, and how they pertain to the mind, and
          specifically how to notice and remedy them as early as possible.
