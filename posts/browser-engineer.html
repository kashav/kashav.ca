      <h1>What it means to be a Browser Engineer</h1>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          I worked on the Firefox browser at Mozilla from 2018-2021. The role
          was vast and all-encompassing.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a day to day basis my tasks spanned all or much of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the site isolation iframe sandboxing project (known internally as
            Fission) -

                >more details</a
              ></em
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            the Gecko browser engine:
            <ul>
              <li>
                web API internals like window.open() and the Document object
              </li>
              <li>
                code for loading webpages, handling documents, rendering frames,
                allocating processes, and more
              </li>
              <li>
                infrastructure for low-level C++ mechanisms like IPC and XPCOM,
                and some parts of the SpiderMonkey JS engine
              </li>
              <li>
                garbage collection, cycle collection, refcounting, and Firefox
                memory overhead in general
              </li>
              <li>and more</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            the cross-platform Firefox Desktop application:
            <ul>
              <li>
                the browser frontend for things like the URL bar and tabs, and
                lots of glue code to enable interaction between the JS frontend
                and C++ backend
              </li>
              <li>
                various devtools modules and their underlying architectures,
                like the inspector and networking
              </li>
              <li>session restore (as owner of the module)</li>
              <li>and more</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            and related projects:
            <ul>
              <li>
                webcompat, and particularly debugging and analyzing websites to
                ensure that Firefox features were implemented correctly
              </li>
              <li>
                searchfox.org, a codesearch tool built by Mozilla and used by
                other open source projects like WebKit
              </li>
              <li>the rr record and replay debugger</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Jumping between vastly different problem spaces was a standard part of
          the job, and work had a tendency of becoming mind-numbing because of
          how much context switching was happening. I found it to be rewarding
          work because of how much I was accomplishing and learning but it was
          stressful work nonetheless.
