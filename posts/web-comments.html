      <h1>Adding monetary value to Internet comments</h1>
      <em>Oct 3, 2024</em>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          For the past few years I have been toying with the idea of an
          idea/thought market&mdash;one where ideas (and more generally thoughts
          as a whole) are somehow assigned some economic value and traded as
          such (for everything and anything that means). In lieu of that I have
          recently been thinking about Internet comments and what it would mean
          to add monetary value to comments on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a huge fan of Hacker News and love reading comments on the
          website. Earlier in my career (circa 2016) I'd spend hours on the
          website reading and debating comments to form opinions of my own. At
          some point I read a brief comment about FUD in software engineering
          and more generally on the Internet as a whole which led me to focus
          less time on the comments and more time on the content of the posts
          themselves. I can't find that particular comment but consider it to
          have been helpful for myself for learning to deal with the abundance
          of user generated content on the Internet. Put generally,
          understanding FUD helps me personally filter good user comments from
          bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider money to be a universal language that can be used to bridge
          gaps between a variety of factors or biases. Now internet comments in
          their current state are sorted based on context - either
          upvotes/downvotes on forums like reddit, Hacker News, or Stack
          Overflow, or just "likes" on social media websites like Twitter or
          Instagram. Adding some universal monetary value to these comments
          could make it easier to discern/qualify good and useful user input
          from bad and useless user input, both on individual websites and
          comparatively across different services. The currency could take just
          about any form&mdash;standard USD, or some Internet currency like
          cryptocurrency, or some browser metric, or a custom Chrome extension
          value, or just about anything else. I haven't thought about how
          money/currency creation would work here but I'm sure it's not that
          difficult a problem, especially if bidders are using standard USD to
          vote on content. Comments could even get value based on user
          impression or an AI-generated sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could also give lieu to some sort of Internet comment database to
          serve collections or dumps of comments from across the web. It would
          work by sorting and classifying the most valuable user comments, using
          this universal metric, for some time period and then showcasing top
          content or interesting finds. I think it'd be an awesome addition to
          the Internet.
