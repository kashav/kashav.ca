      <h1>Adding monetary value to Internet comments</h1>
      <em>Oct 3, 2024</em>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          For the past few years I have been toying with the idea of an
          idea/thought market&mdash;one where ideas (and more generally thoughts
          as a whole) are somehow assigned some economic value and traded as
          such (for everything and anything that means). In lieu of that I have
          recently been thinking about Internet comments and what it would mean
          to add monetary value to comments on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a huge fan of Hacker News and love reading comments on the
          website. Earlier in my career (circa 2016) I'd spend hours on the
          website reading and debating comments to form opinions of my own. At
          some point I read a brief comment about FUD in software engineering
          and more generally on the Internet as a whole which led me to focus
          less time on the comments and more time on the content of the posts
          themselves. I can't find that particular comment but consider it to
          have been helpful for myself for learning to deal with the abundance
          of user generated content on the Internet. Put generally,
          understanding FUD helps me personally filter good user comments from
          bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider money to be a universal language that can be used to bridge
          gaps between a variety of factors or biases&mdash;one such use case
          obviously being to assign quality to things (or to differentiate good
          things from bad). Internet comments however are sorted by upvotes or
          downvotes&mdash;and sometimes just upvotes. Adding some universal
          monetary value to these comments could make it easier to
          discern/qualify good and useful user commentary from bad and useless
          user commentary, both on individual websites and also comparatively
          across different services. The currency could take just about any
          form&mdash;standard USD, an Internet currency like cryptocurrency, a
          browser provided metric, a custom Chrome extension value, or anything
          else. I haven't thought about how money/currency creation would work
          here but I'm sure it's not a difficult problem, especially if bidders
          are using standard USD to vote on content. Comments could even receive
          value based on simple user impression or AI-generated sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could also give lieu to some sort of Internet comment database
          which would serve collections or dumps of comments from across the
          web. It'd be able to use this universal monetary metric to sort and
          classify the most valuable user comments for any given time period and
          then showcase top content or interesting finds. I think it'd be an
          awesome addition to the Internet.
