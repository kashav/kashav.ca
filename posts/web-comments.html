      <h1>Adding monetary value to Internet comments</h1>
      <em>Oct 3, 2024</em>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          For the past few years I have been toying with the idea of an
          idea/thought market&mdash;one where ideas (and more generally thoughts
          as a whole) are somehow assigned some economic value and traded as
          such. In lieu of that I have recently been thinking about Internet
          comments and what it would mean to add monetary value to comments on
          the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a huge fan of Hacker News but early on in my career (circa 2016)
          spent enough time reading comments on the site that it started
          becoming a problem. I'd end up spending hours of my day debating what
          people were saying to form opinions of my own. At some point I read a
          brief comment about FUD on the Internet which helped me focus less
          time on the comments and more time on the content of the posts
          themselves. I can't find that particular comment but consider it to
          have been helpful enough for dealing with content on the Internet in
          general that it still stands out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that often money can be seen as a universal language that
          can be used to bridge gaps between other factors/biases. Internet
          comments in their current state are sorted based on either
          upvotes/downvotes on forums (like reddit, Hacker News, or
          StackOverflow) or just "likes" on social media (like Twitter or
          Instagram). Adding some universal monetary value to these comments
          could make it easier to discern and qualify good and useful user input
          from bad and useless user input. The currency could take just about
          any form&mdash;standard USD or some Internet currency (like
          cryptocurrency or some browser metric or custom Chrome extension
          value) or anything else. I don't know how money/currency creation
          would work here but I'm sure it's not that difficult a problem,
          especially if bidders are using standard USD to vote on content.
        </p>

          It would also give lieu to some sort of Internet comment database to
          serve collections or dumps of comments from across the web. This would
          work by sorting the most valuable user comments for some time period
          and then showcasing and classifying interesting content. I think it
          would be an awesome addition to the Internet.
