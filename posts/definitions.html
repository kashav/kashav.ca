        <p>
          I believe that it is important to be pedantic with definitions. A
          while back I switched my default search engine to DuckDuckGo and
          noticed that its builtin dictionary engine was not as strong as
          Google's.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance a search for <em>define racism</em> yields the following
          top definition with DuckDuckGo:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or
          ability and that a particular race is superior to others.
        </blockquote>
        <p>but this one with Google:</p>
        <blockquote>
          the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics,
          abilities, or qualities, especially so as to distinguish them as
          inferior or superior to one another.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I am of the belief these 2 definitions vary enough to dismay the word
          as a whole. The result in certain situations is that individual people
          or parties have varying (and perhaps conflicting) understandings of
          the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have found that referring to the etymology of a word (particulary
          with etymonline.com) has made it easier to have deeper and richer
          conversations that are also more correct. See again
          <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/racism"
            >https://www.etymonline.com/word/racism</a
          >. Understanding the origin of a word and how it has developed helps
          with gaining a deeper understanding of its meaning. I find that many
          arguments are caused by lack of cohesion in definition.
