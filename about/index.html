          I'm a software engineer at
          <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a> in San Francisco. I worked
          at CircleCI and Cohere in 2022, and at Mozilla until the end of 2021.
          Before that I studied computer science and math at the
          University of Toronto.

          <!--          I've worked on many different things and like having fun. I have
          engineering experience in large and small systems, desktop
          applications, websites and mobile apps, frontend design systems, APIs,
          command line and developer tools, scrapers, programming languages, and
          more -->
          I used to have a tech blog at <a href="https://nestedparens.com/">nestedparens.com</a>.

              A web tool built by reverse engineering Github's avatar algorithm
              to lookup user ids that have a specified avatar pattern. (Their
              user id field appears to be autoincrement so it's theoretically
              possible to side channel your way to any avatar you're interested
              in, if you're into that.)

              Three years of UofTHacks websites and scripts. We built everything
              from scratch each year because of how fast JavaScript and React
              were changing.

              In 2012 I made an iphone game that was inspired by the tap-tap
              music games. I don't have the source or any screenshots but
              included this because I think it was the first significant project
              I worked on.

              A spec-compliant sqlite client. It was kind of terrible, but it
              worked for basic SQL operations. For a grad school Databases
              course.
