          I am a software developer based in Toronto. I enjoy solving complex
          programming problems. I like rap music, fitness, and sports. I have
          passion for knowledge and the mind, and like to be excellent and
          thorough. I have been programming since 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated in 2019 with a Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Science and Mathematics from the University of Toronto in Toronto. I
          enjoyed school and took hard courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating I joined Mozilla and worked on DOM platform code for
          the Firefox browser and Gecko rendering engine. My team was
          responsible for implementing site per process isolation in the browser
          to mitigate the effects of the Spectre CPU vulnerability. This work
          required refactoring much of the Firefox codebase and spanned teams
          across most of the organization. I led large projects early on and
          became owner of the session restore component of the browser. I left
          Mozilla in 2021 shortly after switching to the SpiderMonkey compiler
          team.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of 2022 I joined Cohere to work on ML infrastructure for
          serving LLMs. I didn't stay at Cohere long because I was dealing with
          burnout and the barrier of entry into NLP was higher than expected at
          the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that I was interested in learning Clojure so I joined CircleCI
          as a Senior Security Engineer. I focused on threat detection and
          specifically stopping cryptominers from abusing the free tier of the
          platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023 I moved to San Francisco and joined Airtable as a Product
          Engineer. I worked on implementing full-text search into the backend
          with Rust. I got to work with TypeScript in production which was an
          enjoyable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before university I attempted to start a company with high school
          friends focused on hosting local social networks at events. We
          iterated on the idea for some years and shipped a few web and mobile
          apps in that time. It was called Chapsule because the initial idea was
          to build virtual time capsules for capturing memories and photos to
          look back on later.

          My open source work is at
          <a href="https://github.com/kashav">github.com/kashav</a> (and
          previously
          <a href="https://github.com/kshvmdn">github.com/kshvmdn</a>). I wrote
          a series of blog posts about esoteric programming bugs at
          <a href="https://www.nestedparens.com">nestedparens.com</a>. There is
          a list of my work at <a href="/portfolio/">this link</a>.
