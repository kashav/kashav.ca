          I am a software developer based in Toronto. I enjoy solving complex
          programming problems. I like rap music, fitness, and sports. I have
          passion for the mind, and like to be excellent and thorough. I have 
          been programming since 2011. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated in 2019 with a Honours B.Sc. in Computer Science and
          Mathematics from the University of Toronto in Toronto. I enjoyed
          school and took hard courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating I joined Mozilla and worked on platform code for the
          Firefox browser and Gecko rendering engine. My team was responsible
          for implementing site per process isolation in the browser to mitigate
          the effects of the Spectre CPU vulnerability. This work required
          refactoring much of the Firefox codebase and spanned teams across most
          of the organization. I led large projects early on and became owner of
          the session restore component of the browser. I left Mozilla in 2021
          shortly after switching to the SpiderMonkey compiler team.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of 2022 I joined Cohere to work on ML infrastructure for
          serving LLMs. I didn't stay at Cohere long because I was dealing with
          burnout and the barrier to entry into NLP was higher than expected at
          the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that I joined CircleCI to play around with Clojure. I worked as
          a Senior Security Engineer as a member of the threat detection team.
          We primarily focused on stopping cryptominers from abusing the free
          tier of the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023 I moved to San Francisco and joined Airtable as a product
          engineer. I worked on implementing full-text search into the backend.
          I did not enjoy living the in the States much.

          My open source work is at
          <a href="https://github.com/kashav">github.com/kashav</a> and
          previously
          <a href="https://github.com/kshvmdn">github.com/kshvmdn</a>. I wrote a
          series of blog posts about esoteric programming bugs at
          <a href="https://www.nestedparens.com">nestedparens.com</a>.
